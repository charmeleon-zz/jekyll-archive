After a brief\(ish\) hiatus, I'm blogging again! I had some minor hiccups with Jekyll \(some still unresolved\), but I'm slowly getting the hang of it after dedicating today to fully trying to get it to run the way I want it. The issue was that I was looking at the Pygments/Liquid/Jekyll bootstrap spec, when the issue I was having was related to Markdown (and I had little idea). Compound to this the fact that my `localhost:4000` pages don't appear to update at all and it just seemed like a huge headache.

There's a few things that I'll be writing up over the next few days. I'd like to make a post on all of the struggles that I had when I was building my BitTorrent client (which is now functional, although only to leech!) as well as some reflections on Python overall. Given the unreliability of the localhost:4000 pages at the moment, it may take a while depending on how fast I can troubleshoot it.
