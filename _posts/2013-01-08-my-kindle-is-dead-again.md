### The short version, my Kindle died
As of yesterday, Jan 07, 2013, my Kindle is dead.

### This happened before
I bought a Kindle with Keyboard and 3G/WiFi on August 2011. Six months later,
the top half of the screen went suddenly blank. The bottom half had intersecting
vertical and horizontal lines everywhere. I couldn't read anything, the screen
was faulty and at best the device was now a paperweight. I called Amazon, went
through the "turn it on/off" tech support motions \(I'd done it before calling,
but good luck explaining that\), and after a short conversation a replacement
was on its way. Wunderbar!

### And then it happened again
When the second Kindle arrived, I turned it off and stowed it away since I was
getting busier with other things and had less time for leasure reading. Finally
on October of 2012, I began reading regularly again \(a span of about 14 books
in 3 months\). Yesterday, after 3 months of regular use, the same line pattern
appeared over my Kindle. Coincidence? I think not!

### So I called Amazon
This time the call with Amazon took place under less pleasant circumstances than
the former. I again had to explain that I didn't put undue physical pressure on
the screen of my Kindle. Let me backtrack a bit. Kindles are susceptible to
these lines particularly under physical pressure on the screen. But my Kindle
\(the second one\) has been on the inside pocket of my coat at all times except
when I'm reading, when it's in my hands. When I don't wear my coat it's hanging
on a closet. After these formalities, the Amazon rep put me on hold for eight
minutes while he spoke to his boss \(I assume\). He came back more confused than
I, stating that over a full year had passed since I received it. That wasn't the
case, and after saying this I was again on hold for another five minutes. Now
I'm annoyed, but at least he clarified that my Kindle was out of warranty
because my original purchase was over a year ago, he couldn't do anything but I
could "extend the warranty".

### They couldn't do anything
Turns out this rep and I have a different understanding of "extend the
warranty." He meant to say that I could purchase a new Kindle and then purchase
an extended warranty from Amazon. This took ten minutes to clear up, and I
unwillingly laughed at his suggestion that I buy another Kindle. I wasn't trying
to be mean, but it wasn't obvious to him that I had lost faith in their flagship
eReader when they don't appear to last a full year under regular use. He made
some offer on the warranty that I didn't fully understand -- though not from
lack of trying. I politely declined, said I would think about it \(because he
was now getting pushy on the insistence that I buy another Kindle\), and
terminated the call.

### These screen issues appear to be common
While I was on hold, I found that a loud minority of people have come across
similar issues with their Kindle. The search term "kindle screen lines across"
turns up 3.1m search results on Bing, and 2.7m on Google. I read somewhere that
Amazon suggested the lifetime of a Kindle to be somewhere around 3 years. I didn't expect my Kindle
to last forever, nor for Amazon to call it's expiration date on the dot. But a
50% margin would be nice. Getting two consecutive items fail under very similar
circumstances so far removed from their estimated failure date has me paranoid
over whether or not this is a systematic failure. 

### And I'm really unhappy
A bigger issue, perhaps, is that this was by far the worst costumer service
experience I've had with Amazon. I've had a number of experiences where Amazon
has gone above and beyond to resolve my dissatisfaction with some issue, but
last night it felt like they didn't even go the full length. Somewhere along
the line this agent had decided what he was going to do \(sell me another
Kindle\), and the rest of the conversation regarding my current one was
half-assed.

### And conflicted
But I loved the device, for all its flaws. The ability to carry 50 books in my
pocket was a huge convenience for any errand that extended its due time. The
ability to highlight and store some quote was an excellent feature, the battery
could last me for weeks when I turned wireless connections off, and the screen
was so very easy on the eyes that I could dedicate hours to reading.

### And looking for something else
Now I'm looking at the Sony eReader, which is 10 bucks cheaper with no ads \(but
also no keyboard, although I actually rarely used it\), supports the ePub format
, and multiple dictionaries. I'm not entirely sold just yet, but I can say for
sure that I'll research the hell out of my next eReader, and it will __not__ be
a Kindle.

### Vote with your wallet
So that's my story. I don't think I would enthusiastically endorse the Kindle
anymore, I wouldn't want to be on the hook for when some unfortunate sap has
theirs fail on the third week after the warranty has expired. It's still a nice
device, I just don't feel like I can justify the expense for an item whose
electronic life terminates far too early. Good thing I've backed up my quotes
this time around.
